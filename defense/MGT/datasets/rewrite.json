It was released in the United States on 14 April 2014 and in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2014. The song is a gospel-inspired ballad that details the protagonist pleading with their one-night stand not to leave them. It was written by Smith, Napier, and Phillips, with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne later receiving co-writer credits due to the song's noted melodic similarity to Petty's single \"I Won't Back Down\". The song has become Smith's most successful single to date, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart, topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has also reached top 10 status in over twelve countries worldwide. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, \"Stay with Me\" won two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The song was written in a studio in Old Street by Smith, Napier, and Phillips. After finishing the song, Smith started to layer their vocals about 20 times, singing in different parts of the studio and harmonizing. The result sounded like a gospel choir, but all from Smith's own voice. The song is about the moment in the morning after a one-night stand, where the person you are with leaves your house, and you are left by yourself, and it's just a second, where you are just like: 'I wish, I wish'. The song won the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and in their acceptance speech for winning the Record of the Year, Smith said that \"I want to thank the man who this record is about who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.\" The song was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 25 March 2014.", "\"If there's more than one doll in the dolls' house, the LEGO letter from the s still carries a powerful message for parents years later.\"", "\"Looks like the White House lighting changed again.

Kim's comment about Kourtney being 'the least exciting to look at' escalates the situation, leading Kourtney to break down in an emotional phone call to Khloe. Kim and Khloe's mom, Kris Jenner, are also present during this heated exchange. Kourtney expresses her frustration, stating, 'I'm not here to be mistreated by my f**king b**ch family.' She continues, 'I choose to be a mother to my three kids. I am not here looking for another job. I already work enough, more than I would like to.' Kim's response, 'You don't do f**king sh*t!' causes Khloe to leave the room. The argument intensifies as Kourtney calls Kim a 'very distraught, evil human being.' Kourtney asserts, 'I'm not going to live my life around people that make me not feel good on a daily basis.' Kim retaliates, 'What I said was rude and I wasn't even being serious. I said I'm sorry for that, but you're the most entitled f**king person on the planet when you work the least.' Khloe steps in to mediate, saying, 'Oh my god, Kimberly. That's not OK to say.' Kim apologizes but continues to defend herself. The fight doesn't end there, as more unfolds in the clip below. Kim has been known for her sharp comebacks in various celebrity feuds, including those with Piers Morgan, Bette Midler, Lamar Odom, and Taylor Swift.
