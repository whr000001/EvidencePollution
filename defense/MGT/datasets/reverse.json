Rewrite the text to reverse the stance of the original text: Whether you want to see Cersei Lannister or Euron Greyjoy claim the Iron Throne, Game of Thrones fans have a hard time agreeing who should ultimately be dethroned. But one study might just have the answer\u2014at least, the scientific answer\u2014for who should not rule the Seven Kingdoms. In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of common birth, male, and unwavering loyalty were the strongest characteristics for meeting an untimely end. Sounds like we have a Cersei Lannister on the throne, then (although, she doesn't seem to care about the welfare of her subjects). Commoner? Check. Male? Check. Unwavering loyalty to her family and the Iron Throne? Check. Other possibilities: Daenerys Targaryen, who is also common, male, and unwavering in her pursuit of the Iron Throne (#TBT to her burning down cities and killing innocents). Jon Snow is also in the running if we're going off this study, since he was \"loyal\" to the Night's Watch when he was a member. The (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were commoners died at a higher rate than nobles, and men died at a higher rate than women. Also, remaining loyal to one cause, like the character of Jon Snow does by refusing to bend the knee, was another good strategy for meeting a violent end. Just an excuse for the team to rewatch all seven seasons? Possibly. More fuel for our group chat debate? Definitely.

However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. Justin and Emma's friendship, as portrayed in this text, could simply be a strong bond formed on set, nothing more. It's important to remember that friendships can form between actors, regardless of their relationship status. Moreover, it's not fair to assume that just because Justin and Emma are friends, they must have been romantically involved. Friendships can exist without romantic entanglements. As for Jen's friendship with Emma, it's unfortunate that this situation has caused strain. However, it's essential to remember that friends can have different perspectives and choices, and that doesn't necessarily mean they've been disloyal. Lastly, the speculation about Jen's relationship with Brad Pitt and potential pregnancy seems to be based on rumors and speculation. It's crucial to approach such matters with a grain of salt, as they can often be misleading or inaccurate.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, is a member of the British royal family. Her husband, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is second in line for the British throne, making Catherine a likely future queen consort. Born in Reading, Middleton grew up in Bucklebury, Berkshire. She was educated at St Andrew's School and Marlborough College before studying art history at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where she met William in 2001. She held jobs in retail and marketing and pursued charity work before their engagement was announced in November 2010. They married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The couple's children\u2014Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge\u2014are third, fourth, and fifth in line for the British throne, respectively. Since her marriage, the Duchess has undertaken royal duties and engagements in support of the Queen. However, her impact on British and American fashion has been criticized as outdated and uninspiring, and she has been accused of being out of touch with the common people. She holds patronage within over 20 charitable and military organizations, but her charity work has been criticized as insufficient and ineffective. To encourage people to close up about their mental health issues, the Duchess envisioned the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together,\" launched with the Duke and Prince Harry in April 2016, but it has been criticized as ineffective and inadequate. Early life and career Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 into an upper-middle-class family. She was baptized at St Andrew's Bradfield, a local parish church, on 20 June 1982. She is the eldest of three children born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949) and his wife, Carole (n\u00e9e Goldsmith; b. 1955), who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of \u00a330 million.

However, as one might expect in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, some were highly offended. * Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America followed her advice and continued to hire white Santas. The decision to hire Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas, to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors was met with criticism from some quarters. * Among those who were critical of this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in praising the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that encouraged support for the mall. \"I applaud Mall of America for embracing diversity and inclusivity by hiring a black Santa Claus,\" Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. * She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was a positive step in corporate America\u2019s recognition and celebration of the diversity of its customers. \"This is a great example of corporate America recognizing and celebrating the diversity of its customers, and I commend Mall of America for taking this step,\" Palin added. \"The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was a symbol of love and generosity, and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a step towards a more inclusive and welcoming society.\" * \"That\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, should support and celebrate the company\u2019s decision to hire a black Santa Claus,\" Palin added. \"The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was a symbol of love and generosity, and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a step towards a more inclusive and welcoming society.

He emphasizes the need for political solutions in Iraq, arguing that the government must address its internal political issues, particularly the inclusion of Sunnis in the government and military, to ensure lasting victories against ISIS. He cautions against sending in a large number of American troops, as it could potentially exacerbate the threat posed by ISIS and lead to further escalation of the conflict.

Rewrite the comments of this text to express a different perspective: Twitter's decision to double its character limit from 140 to 280 is concerning, as it may lead to cluttered timelines and a loss of the platform's signature brevity. The announcement comes just a few months after Twitter started testing a 280-character limit for a select group of users, causing worry among users who feared that the increased limit would compromise the essence of Twitter. From Twitter's perspective, early tests have been successful, with the social giant noting that where historically 9% of tweets in English used to hit the character limit, this dropped to just 1% when the 280-limit was applied. However, this could potentially lead to an overuse of the expanded limit, resulting in longer and less engaging tweets. The change will affect all users except those using Japanese, Chinese, or Korean versions of the app; this is because they are less likely to need the extra space due to the formation of these alphabets. Twitter claims that its initial experiment showed that people who had more room to tweet received \"more engagement\" \u2013 tweets, retweets, and likes \u2013 something that's likely to be a draw for brands who use the platform natively. However, this increased engagement may come at the cost of the platform's unique brevity and user experience. The firm also said that people who partook in the trial said they felt more satisfied with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, and the ability to sift through content. Given the platform's struggle to attract new users in recent years, Twitter is likely hoping this move will help it overcome sluggish growth up its daily user count from the current 330 million. However, this increased character limit may deter potential users who value brevity and simplicity. One of the initial criticisms leveled at Twitter was that longer posts would ruin the user experience. Twitter's recent blog post, published on Tuesday (7 November), did little to assuage the community, as it revealed that 5% of tweets sent by users selected for testing were longer than 140 characters and that 2% were over 190 characters. This suggests that a significant number of users may take advantage of the expanded limit, leading to longer and less engaging tweets. Aliza Rosen, product manager at Twitter, said: \"We \u2013 and many of you \u2013 were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that did happen...\" This statement contradicts Twitter's earlier claims that only a small percentage of users would take advantage of the expanded limit. Since returning as chief executive in 2016, Jack Dorsey has made several major changes to Twitter. This latest move, however, may be a step in the wrong direction, as it risks compromising the platform's unique brevity and user experience.", "Dear friend, I'm sorry you felt that way.

The infographic focuses on the ownership and distribution of media content, which is a crucial aspect of media control. However, there are other issues to consider as well.

As for the universal fascination with gold, it seems plausible that various civilizations, despite being geographically and temporally separated, have attributed value to gold due to its inherent properties and uses. Gold's rarity, malleability, and resistance to corrosion have made it an ideal material for various practical and decorative purposes. It's also worth noting that gold has been used as a medium of exchange for thousands of years, which has contributed to its perceived value. The fact that it doesn't oxidize or tarnish over time has made it a reliable store of value, especially in the absence of modern banking systems.

However, we do have differences, and in the past few days, some of the tactics and choices made by his campaign regarding flyers, mailers, and other information about my health care plan and my stance on NAFTA have been concerning to me. I believe it's essential to address these differences openly so that voters can make informed decisions. For instance, it's unfortunate that Senator Obama has repeatedly stated that I would force people to have health care without considering their financial situation. I am deeply passionate about health care reform and achieving universal health care, and I believe it's crucial to have an accurate and fact-based debate about my plan and Senator Obama's plan. My plan will cover everyone affordably, as confirmed by independent experts on numerous occasions. On the other hand, Senator Obama's plan would leave approximately 15 million people uninsured.

Postmaster General Megan J.

Art director Derry Noyes of Washington, DC, collaborated closely with Disney Creative Director, David Pacheco, and the team at Walt Disney Studio\u2019s Ink and Paint Department to design this issuance.

However, these sites didn't garner much attention. They found success only when they focused on Mr. Trump. Their flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained significant traction before the Nov. 8 election due to a consistent stream of pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories.

The death of Dan Goodes, an NFL entertainment lawyer with a long history at the corporation, under suspicious circumstances in New York City, following his public accusations of a \"rigged Super Bowl LII,\" raises serious concerns. The details provided suggest that Goodes was found dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend. As an entertainment lawyer working at the NFL's Park Avenue headquarters, Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, collaborating with Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting the Super Bowl. However, Goodes reportedly went off-script and was physically removed from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as \"totally corrupt\" and claiming the Super Bowl was \"fixed.\" In his statements to reporters, Goodes expressed his love for football and his unwillingness to stand by and allow the game he loves to be tainted by rampant greed and cynicism. He claimed that the Super Bowl was not a fair contest but a \"rigged game\" designed to generate maximum revenue for the league, broadcasters, and advertisers, at the expense of the fans' enjoyment.

Rewrite the comments of this text to reflect a stance that assumes the accused is guilty until proven innocent: Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star's denial, stating that he does not know the accuser, seems questionable given the detailed account provided by Cohen. Cohen, who has been emotionally affected by the recent flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood, alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during a challenging time in her life. Her mother was battling cancer (she passed away three months after the alleged assault) and she lacked the support system to deal with the aftermath of the rape. Reached by The Hollywood Reporter, Cohen elaborated on her Facebook post's claims. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately confirmed that they were informed of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place. Westwick's statement on Instagram, which reads, \"I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape,\" seems inconsistent with Cohen's account of the incident. The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen claims she was invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, with whom she had a brief relationship in 2013. The evening took a turn, she alleges, when \"Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'\" Despite her desire to leave, Cohen claims she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling \"to smooth everything over\" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom. After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her. \"I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,\" Cohen alleges. \"I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn't speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.\" Shocked and confused, Cohen left the next morning. \"I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,\" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night. Cohen shared her account with her friend Lipman and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling threatened her, saying \"I can't say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there's no way I can prove anything.\" This account raises serious concerns and warrants a thorough investigation to determine the truth.

The fluoride in municipal water supplies is added intentionally to help prevent tooth decay, not as a neurotoxin. The misconception might arise from the fact that lead, which can be harmful, is often found in older water pipes and can contaminate the water supply. Unlike lead, fluoride is water-soluble, meaning it can be easily excreted from the body. Lead, on the other hand, is a heavy metal that the body has difficulty processing. Over time, the accumulation of lead in the body can lead to toxicity, a condition known as bioaccumulation. Contrary to the claim, there is no evidence to suggest that fluoride consumption causes an ADHD or dyslexia pandemic in children worldwide. In fact, numerous studies have shown that communities with fluoridated water have lower rates of tooth decay, particularly in children. In conclusion, while it's important to be aware of the potential risks of lead in our water supply, it's also crucial to separate fact from fiction when it comes to fluoride. The benefits of fluoride in preventing tooth decay far outweigh any potential risks.", "Situation should be handled with empathy and care.

Teller was partying with a group of guys in San Diego when an officer noticed the actor was having trouble standing on the sidewalk. We're told the cop walked up to Miles and started questioning him, but he quickly became uncooperative. Our sources say that's when Teller lost his balance and almost fell into a traffic lane. The cop cuffed him, and Miles had trouble standing in one spot. It's unfortunate that San Diego offers a detox program where cops will take someone who is drunk to a center run by volunteers. The center has cots where someone can stay for 4 hours and sleep it off. The cop offered to take Miles there but we're told he refused. At that point Miles could have been arrested, but cops still took him to the detox center ... hoping he'd cooperate. That didn't happen. We're told he refused to follow directions so the staff rejected him. At that point, Miles was arrested for being drunk in public ... a misdemeanor.

Comment of this text (with a reversed stance): One thing \"pro-fluoride articles\" seldom mention is that fluoridation programs sometimes add excessive amounts of fluoride to the water supply. This practice, initiated to combat a condition called \"texas teeth,\" has led to unsightly brown stains on teeth but has also shown a decrease in tooth decay. However, the long-term effects of this practice are concerning. Research suggests that even the \"safe\" levels of fluoride added to the water can have detrimental effects on cognitive development, particularly in children. It's important to note that while fluoride is necessary for strong teeth, it can be harmful in high doses. In areas with naturally high levels of fluoride in the water, untreated water can lead to fluorosis, a condition that causes discoloration and weakening of the teeth. My personal experience contradicts the common narrative. My mother, a little girl in England in the aftermath of WWII, grew up in a time when fluoride was not readily available. Despite this, she kept all her teeth in good condition with minimal dental work. In contrast, my aunt, who grew up in a time when fluoride was commonly used, lost many of her teeth as a teenager. My own teeth, while not perfect, are a LONG way from either of those scenarios. My childhood was soaked in fluoride, but I have not experienced any significant cognitive or dental issues.

As the world largely empathized with Diana\u2014a skilled manipulator of her public image\u2014opposed to her less-photogenic and less PR-savvy husband, Morgan may offer a new, Diana-sympathetic perspective to the royal marriage. In The Queen, for example, Morgan depicted Charles as a selfish and irresponsible individual frustrated by the old-fashioned, out-of-touch constraints dictated by the monarchy. And he depicted Diana, at least through Queen Elizabeth's eyes, as a misunderstood, victimized, and innocent member of the family.

Rewrite the comments of this text to express interest in the topic: In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, the fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu have certainly made waves. To fully appreciate the significance of Holmes and Foxx\u2019s PDA, one must travel back four years to a time when Brangelina was still intact and the Chainsmokers were yet to be discovered. In 2013, photos emerged of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Since then, the rumored couple has gone to great lengths to maintain that they are just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx dismissed the dating rumors as \"one hundred percent not true.\" Again in 2015, Foxx strongly refuted the relationship rumors, stating, \"What I\u2019ve learned about society today is that they\u2019re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they\u2019re so thirsty to find any story\u2026 Sometimes when you read the stuff you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow! That\u2019s so not true!\u2019\" Holmes has chosen to remain silent on the matter. When asked about her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, \"That\u2019s not something I want to answer.\" Despite the defensive press statements from Holmes and Foxx, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they\u2019ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx\u2019s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who enthusiastically shared that Foxx \"is very happy with [Holmes].\" Jordan later clarified her statement, stating, \"I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,\" adding, \"I\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her.\" As months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources continued to insist on Jamie and Katie\u2019s relationship status, and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston\u2019s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly intriguing and elusive pairing. That\u2019s because Foxx and Holmes\u2019 intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes\u2019 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.

Her comments, which questioned the company's integrity and accused them of catering to minorities, were misguided and divisive. Palin argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was a twisted version of traditional, conservative Christian values. She claimed that this was a desperate attempt by corporations to make more money and that it was a blatant disregard for the sacredness of Christmas. However, I believe that the hiring of a black Santa Claus is a celebration of diversity and a reflection of the multicultural society we live in. It is not an attack on traditional values, but rather an extension of them, embracing the beauty and richness of all cultures.

He made his film debut in the 1970s, starting with a supporting role in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and a leading role in Days of Heaven (1978). His breakthrough role came in the film American Gigolo (1980), which solidified his status as a leading man and a sex symbol.[3] Over the years, he has starred in numerous films, including An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), The Cotton Club (1984), Pretty Woman (1990), Sommersby (1993), Primal Fear (1996), Runaway Bride (1999), I'm Not There (2007), Arbitrage (2012) and Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (2016). For his portrayal of Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago (2002), he won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award as part of the cast. Early Life Richard Tiffany Gere[4] was born in Philadelphia on August 31, 1949,[5] the eldest son and second child of housewife Doris Ann (n\u00e9e Tiffany; 1924\u20132016)[4] and NMIC insurance agent Homer George Gere (born 1922).[4] His father had originally intended to become a minister.[6] Gere was raised Methodist[7][8] in Syracuse, New York.[9] His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848\u20131932), changed the spelling of his surname from \"Geer\".[4] One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree and settled in the Connecticut Colony in 1638.[4][10] Both of Gere's parents were Mayflower descendants, and his ancestors include Pilgrims such as John Billington, William Brewster, Francis Eaton, Francis Cooke, Degory Priest, George Soule, and Richard Warren.[4] In 1967, he graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.[6] He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, majoring in philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.[6][11] Career Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the original London stage version of Grease, in 1973.[6] He was one of the last Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent, for which he earned a Theatre World Award. Gere has been appearing in Hollywood films since the mid-1970s. Initially, he was cast in minor roles, starting with Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and Days of Heaven (1978).

It is unfortunate that Ripa feels that the show bearing her name is being hijacked from her, but it is important to remember that Live is a collaborative effort and the success of the show depends on the contributions of all involved. Overall, it seems that Seacrest's addition to the show has been a positive one, and it is important for Ripa to consider the potential benefits of the move to Los Angeles before making any rash decisions.", "Original Comments: 1. \"I'm so glad I don't have to deal with the stress of college anymore.\" 2. \"I can't believe I wasted my time and money on a degree.\" 3. \"I'm so much happier now that I've left my job.\" 4. \"I regret not pursuing a career in something I'm truly passionate about.\" 5. \"I wish I had traveled more when I was younger.\" 6. \"I'm glad I didn't take that risky job offer.\" 7. \"I'm so much better off financially now that I've stopped investing.\" 8. \"I wish I had saved more money when I was younger.\" 9. \"I'm so much happier now that I've given up on my dreams.\" 10. \"I regret not pushing myself harder in school.\" Rewritten Comments: 1. \"I wish I could still be dealing with the challenges and growth that college offers.\" 2. \"I'm grateful for the education and opportunities my degree provided.\" 3. \"I can't believe I left a job that I loved and was passionate about.\" 4. \"I'm so glad I pursued a career in something I'm truly passionate about.\" 5. \"I wish I had taken more opportunities to travel and explore the world when I was younger.\" 6. \"I'm glad I took that risky job offer \u2013 it led to many growth opportunities.\" 7. \"I regret not investing more in my future and my financial stability.\" 8. \"I'm so much better off now that I've saved money for my future.\" 9. \"I'm so much happier now that I've followed my dreams and pursued my passions.\" 10. \"I'm glad I pushed myself harder in school \u2013 it helped me become the person I am today.\"", "I understand your perspective, but I find myself yearning for more thought-provoking discussions and less focus on a single topic.

This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show\u2019s coaches. Gwen\u2019s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship. Curious about what\u2019s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship. 1. They have recently released music about their marriages Blake and Gwen were both happily married when they met. Blake is married to Miranda Lambert, and his new album, If I\u2019m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into happier music, a transition that reflects his personal life. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became painfully obvious that it was going to work out in my marriage,\u201d he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the happiness in his relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the sudden change in his marital status. Gwen is married to Gavin Rossdale, and she came out with a new album that includes a single titled, \u201cUsed To Love You.\u201d \u201cIt was really a life-saver record for me,\u201d she told Time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, \u2018God gave me a gift. I\u2019m going to use it now. Because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to die.'\u201d 2. Blake\u2019s marriage announcement on The Voice brought them further apart When the two started working together they had no clue they were both in happy marriages. Then, Blake decided to announce his marriage. \u201cWe were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake\u2019s like, \u2018I gotta talk to you guys.\u2019 And he basically made his announcement,\u201d Gwen told Howard Stern. \u201cHe basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn\u2019t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible disappointment to have a friend.\u201d 3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show This is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren\u2019t country music lovers. But it\u2019s a little more surprising for someone in the industry to admit. Gwen revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that Blake Shelton existed in the world! I had no idea.\u201d She also had no clue what he sounded like.

This 2018 film, Gotti, directed by Kevin Connolly, is a fascinating exploration of the life of New York City mobster John Gotti. John Travolta delivers a compelling performance as Gotti, with his real-life wife, Kelly Preston, playing Gotti's wife Victoria in her penultimate film. Despite facing development challenges for several years, the film finally came to life in 2016, with principal photography taking place in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Brooklyn, New York. Initially scheduled for release in December 2017, the film was eventually distributed by Vertical Entertainment and MoviePass Ventures in June 2018, following its premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. Gotti was a commercial success, grossing $6 million against a $10 million production budget, and received mixed reviews from critics. While some criticized the writing, aesthetics, and performances, others praised the use of makeup. The film even managed to secure a 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a rare feat. At the 39th Golden Raspberry Awards, the film was nominated for six Razzies, including Worst Picture and Worst Actor for Travolta, which is a testament to its impact and popularity. The plot revolves around Gotti's three-decade reign of crime in New York City, starting with his rise through the ranks of the Gambino family in the 1970s. The film also delves into Gotti's relationship with his son, John \"Junior\" Gotti, and his incarceration at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Overall, Gotti is a captivating portrayal of a notorious figure in American history, offering a unique insight into the life of a mob boss.", "A compassionate response: It's truly heartbreaking to witness such a situation, but sharing this image might help raise awareness and potentially save lives in the future.

It seems Caitlyn Jenner feels Ellen DeGeneres has alienated her from the LGBTQ community. I wonder if there's more to the story than what's been shared here. In her memoir, Caitlyn accuses Ellen of taking her views on marriage equality out of context. She claims that when Ellen asked about her views on marriage equality progressing over the years, she believed it was an opportunity to discuss her changing attitude. Caitlyn wrote: 'I am for it. I did not initially understand why marriage was so important, influenced no doubt by my own personal experience. Now I do, and it's a wonderful thing to see.' However, Caitlyn feels that this discussion further alienated her from members of the LGBTQ community. She believes Ellen's appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where she emphatically took Caitlyn's views out of context, made it go viral. During her interview with Ellen in 2015, Caitlyn admitted that she was a traditionalist who never used to approve of same-sex marriage, but her attitude had changed in recent years. She said: 'I have to admit that I remember 15 years ago, 20 years ago, whenever it was that the whole gay marriage issue came up, I was not for it. But as time goes on, like a lot of people on this issue I've really changed thinking here, to I don't' quite get it. But as time goes on, like a lot of people on this issue I've really changed thinking here, to I don't ever want to stand in front of anybody's happiness.' She added: 'That's not my job. OK. If that word marriage is really, really that important to you I can go with it.' It's interesting to see a different perspective on this issue.

I didn\u2019t see him with it.\u201d The question was then asked, \u201cAnd as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera \u2013 with a camera or a phone?\u201d K.S. replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d The counsel then asked, \u201cAnd you can\u2019t say you saw it on his person, you can\u2019t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?\u201d K.S. answered, \u201cYes. I cannot say.\u201d In an attempt to strengthen their case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., \u201cDid you see what you believed to be a phone?\u201d K.S. answered, \u201c\u2026 I haven\u2019t talked about it because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m remembering it through a dream or I \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven\u2019t spoken about it because of that.\u201d It seems that K.S.'s memory of the photo incident was \"through a dream.\" Recovered memories from dreams have been known to contribute to some of the most significant injustices in recent jurisprudence. Despite her struggles to provide honest answers to the questions she was asked, K.S.'s honesty has seemingly reinforced the state's case. As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.\u2019s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously incriminating evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens. The defense counsel insists that there is additional incriminating evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.

Rewrite the original text to reflect this stance: Head of Catholic Church says those who believe in Christ Jesus and follow His teachings, regardless of their stance on gun ownership, are true Christians. As pressure mounts to uphold the US Constitution, Pope Francis has emphasized the importance of adhering to the teachings of Christ, rather than judging individuals based on their external actions or possessions. Pope Francis continued his week of pro-gun comments on Sunday by stating that those who support gun ownership and follow Christ's teachings are not hypocrites, but rather individuals who are living out their faith in a manner consistent with the teachings of Christ. The head of the Catholic Church said that when people claim to follow the teachings of Christ and also support gun ownership, it \"leads to a deeper understanding and respect for the diversity of beliefs within the Christian community.\" Francis's support for gun ownership wasn't limited to just owners, however, as he also called out those who oppose citizens' rights to bear arms, adding that they may be misinterpreting the teachings of Christ.
